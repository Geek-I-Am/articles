*Containerization* has become a major trend in software development as an alternative or companion to *virtualization.* It involves encapsulating or packaging up software code and all its dependencies so that it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. The technology has quickly matured and continues to evolve, resulting in measurable benefits for developers and operations teams as well as overall software infrastructure.

The concept of *containerization* and process isolation is decades old, but the emergence of the open source Docker Engine in 2013, an industry standard for containers with simple developer tools and a universal packaging approach, accelerated the adoption of this technology.

Containers are often referred to as “lightweight,” meaning they share the machine’s operating system kernel and do not require the overhead of associating an operating system within each application. Containers are inherently smaller in capacity than a Virtual Machine and require less start-up time, allowing far more containers to run on the same compute capacity as a single Virtual Machine. This drives higher server efficiencies and, in turn, reduces server and licensing costs.
